 * This program creates the game of Hangman and allows a user to play multiple games. It chooses a random word from a very large lexicon and asks the user
 * to guess individual letters. The program is set such that the user gets 8 incorrect guesses before he or she loses the game. If the user guesses all
 * of the letters of the word before all 8 incorrect guesses have been used, he or she wins. After each game is completed, the user is asked whether he or
 * she would like to play another game. If the user inputs 'y', then another game is set up. If 'n' is entered, the session is completed, and the user
 * receives statistics that include all of the games the user played during the session. Lecture slides and the Java reference pages on Oracle's web site
 * were used when developing the ins and outs of this program.
