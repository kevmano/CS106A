/**
 * CS 106A Homework 3: Breakout
 *
 * This file contains several constant values that you should use in your
 * Breakout game code.  Your program should adapt properly if these constants
 * are changed to reasonable values.  You do not need to worry about your
 * program's behavior with strange values such as a negative brick size.
 *
 * Your program should work properly with an UNMODIFIED version of this file.
 * You can and should modify the constants' values for testing, but you should
 * not add any new constants here.  If you want additional constants for your
 * code, please add them to your own Breakout.java file, not here.
